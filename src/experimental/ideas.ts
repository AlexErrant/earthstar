/*

make queryFollower work over the network

make a message-based protocol and somehow make it work over http

turn Peer into MultiStorage
    - maybe change StorageAsync to always need the workspace, so they can have identical method signatures
    - to sync MultiStorages
        - find common workspaces
        - make QueryFollowers for each workspace
